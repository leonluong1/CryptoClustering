# Crypto Clustering Analysis
Module 19 Unsupervised Learning Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining the price changes in crypto currencies over time and predicting future changes using machine learning and clustering. We have a Jupyter Notebook file that contains starter code. 

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my KMeans, Python, HvPlot and PCA knowledge. I created dataframe using the crypto csv. Then, I created the KMeans clustering models and trained those models using the crypto dataframe. I predicted the clustering using the trained models. Finally, I created visualizations to depict the datapoints and their clustering.

The file types in this repository are ipynb, csv and md files.
